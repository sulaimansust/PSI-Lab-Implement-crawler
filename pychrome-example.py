Extensive example script for using pychrome.

In order to use this script, you have to start Google Chrome/Chromium
with remote debugging as follows:
    google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --enable-automation

You can also run in headless mode, which doesn't require a graphical
user interface by supplying --headless.
